# Dynamic Keyword Insertion Contract

Date: 2026-07-24

## Decision

Siamrooftech can support dynamic keyword insertion for Google Ads, but only through approved tokens.

Do not render raw search terms, raw `{keyword}`, or arbitrary URL text into public copy.

Approved pattern:

```text
/services/retractable-awning?ad_kw=retractable_awning&ad_audience=home&ad_area=bangkok
```

Rejected pattern:

```text
/lp/google-ads/กันสาดพับเก็บได้ราคาถูกมากที่สุด
/services/retractable-awning?keyword=กันสาดพับเก็บได้ราคาถูกมากที่สุดในไทย
```

## What Dynamic Keyword Insertion Means Here

Google Ads keyword insertion in ad text uses syntax such as:

```text
{KeyWord:กันสาดพับเก็บได้}
```

Landing page dynamic insertion is different. The landing page reads controlled URL parameters and swaps a limited set of approved text fragments, such as the hero headline, eyebrow, CTA context, or proof heading.

This contract covers landing page dynamic insertion only.

## Goals

- Improve message match between ad group and landing page.
- Keep the same SEO-safe service URL architecture.
- Avoid thin duplicate landing pages.
- Preserve clean canonical URLs.
- Keep every dynamic phrase reviewed and brand-safe.
- Make Ads reporting segmentable by service, audience, area, and token.

## Non-Goals

- No raw keyword rendering.
- No auto-created pages per keyword.
- No dynamic schema claims that are not visible on the page.
- No indexable query-parameter variants.
- No automatic copy generation from `srt_keyword` or `{keyword}`.

## Query Parameter Contract

Dynamic content parameters:

| Parameter | Purpose | Example | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ad_kw` | Approved service keyword bucket | `retractable_awning` | Final URL or final URL suffix |
| `ad_audience` | Approved customer segment | `home` | Final URL or final URL suffix |
| `ad_area` | Approved service area | `bangkok` | Final URL or final URL suffix |
| `ad_intent` | Approved conversion intent | `quote` | Optional |

Tracking parameters remain separate:

| Parameter family | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `utm_*` | Analytics source/campaign reporting |
| `srt_*` | Siamrooftech internal Ads diagnostics |
| `gclid`, `gbraid`, `wbraid` | Google auto-tagging / click identifiers |
| `gad_source`, `gad_campaignid` | Google click/campaign diagnostics |

Do not use `srt_keyword` as rendered page copy. It is an attribution field only.

## Survey Gate

Every paid click is followed by a mandatory 1-question persona survey before the LINE button opens LINE. This exists to send a lead-quality signal back to Google, not to route leads to sales -- every persona still reaches LINE, the survey only labels the click.

**Gate condition: `gclid`, `gbraid`, or `wbraid` presence only. Never `utm_*`, `srt_*`, or `ad_*`.**

Rationale:

- `utm_*` and `ad_*` params can be copied into any shared link, bookmarked, or crawled -- gating on them would show the survey to organic visitors and pollute the persona data with non-paid traffic.
- `gclid`/`gbraid`/`wbraid` are appended only by Google Ads auto-tagging and cannot appear on organic or shared links in practice.
- `gclid` is also the join key for any future offline conversion adjustment (via Data Manager API, see below), so gating on the same identifier keeps the signal consistent end to end.

Mechanism:

1. `src/middleware.ts` sets cookie `srt_paid=1` (`Max-Age=1800`, i.e. 30 minutes, `path=/`, `sameSite=lax`) whenever the request URL contains `gclid`, `gbraid`, or `wbraid`. This applies site-wide, not only on the five `/services/*` paths eligible for the `/lp/google-ads/*` rewrite, because the floating LINE buttons (`LineButtonsLayout`) render on every route and a paid visitor commonly browses `/portfolio` before messaging.
2. A capture-phase click listener in `src/app/components/AttributionCapture.tsx` intercepts any click on an `a[href*="lin.ee"], a[href*="line.me"]` link. If `srt_paid=1` is present and no persona has been recorded yet this session, it blocks navigation and shows `LeadSurveyModal` (single mandatory question, no skip).
3. The answer is stored in the existing `siamrooftech_attribution_v1` localStorage object as `lead_persona`, `lead_quality_score`, `lead_survey_answered_at` -- reusing the attribution store means every event tracked afterward (via `attribution_*` passthrough) automatically carries `attribution_lead_persona`.
4. `line_survey_complete` fires with `lead_persona`, `lead_quality_score` (0 or 1), and `value` (0 or 1, same as score), then LINE opens via `window.open` in the same click-handler call stack (required to avoid popup blockers).
5. The 30-minute window intentionally does not persist across days: a visitor who clicked an ad and returns to message LINE the next day will not see the survey. This is treated as missing data, not wrong data, and does not pollute the signal sent to Google.

Do not widen the gate condition to `ad_*` or `utm_*` parameters, and do not extend the cookie lifetime without an explicit decision to do so -- both were deliberately rejected to keep organic traffic friction-free.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `bangkok` | กรุงเทพ | `/services/retractable-awning/bangkok` |
| `nonthaburi` | นนทบุรี | `/services/retractable-awning/nonthaburi` |

| `ayutthaya` | อยุธยา | Future local page only when approved |
| `samut_sakhon` | สมุทรสาคร | Future local page only when approved |

### `ad_intent`

| Token | Label | Allowed effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quote` | ประเมินราคา | CTA and supporting copy can mention quote/estimate |
| `consult` | ปรึกษาหน้างาน | CTA and supporting copy can mention consultation |
| `compare` | เปรียบเทียบระบบ | Supporting copy can mention manual/electric comparison |

## Rendering Rules

The page may personalize:

- hero eyebrow
- hero headline
- hero supporting paragraph
- CTA supporting context
- proof section intro
- FAQ ordering or one approved dynamic FAQ

The page must not personalize:

- canonical URL
- sitemap URL
- JSON-LD URL fields
- `meta.title` and `meta.description` for query-parameter variants
- hidden text
- claims about price, warranty, delivery speed, or performance unless already approved as static copy

## Copy Composition

The renderer must compose copy only from approved tokens.

Example:

```text
ad_kw=retractable_awning
ad_audience=home
ad_area=bangkok
```

Can render:

```text
ติดตั้งกันสาดพับเก็บได้สำหรับบ้านพักอาศัยในกรุงเทพ
```

If a token is missing or invalid, use the default static service page copy.

If token combinations conflict, ignore the conflicting token.

Examples:

| URL token combination | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `/services/retractable-awning?ad_kw=electric_awning` | Ignore `ad_kw`; the page is not the electric service page |
| `/services/electric-retractable-awning?ad_kw=retractable_awning` | Ignore `ad_kw`; page controls service identity |
| `/services/retractable-awning/bangkok?ad_area=nonthaburi` | Ignore `ad_area`; path area wins |
| `/services/retractable-awning?ad_audience=unknown` | Ignore invalid audience token |

## Path Strategy

Default public Final URL:

```text
/services/[service]?ad_kw=...&ad_audience=...&ad_area=...
```

Implementation:

- Clean `/services/...` pages stay SSG/ISR for SEO.
- Middleware rewrites approved Ads query variants to `/lp/google-ads/...` internally.
- Browser-visible URL remains `/services/...?...`.
- Canonical, JSON-LD URLs, sitemap URLs, and organic internal links remain clean `/services/...` URLs.

Use existing local pages when the location intent already has a canonical page:

```text
/services/retractable-awning/bangkok?ad_audience=home
/services/retractable-awning/nonthaburi?ad_audience=restaurant
/services/retractable-awning/pathum-thani?ad_audience=home
```

Create separately promoted Ads LP paths only after paid data proves a need:

```text
/lp/google-ads/retractable-awning-home
/lp/google-ads/retractable-awning-restaurant
/lp/google-ads/electric-retractable-awning-home
```

Do not create keyword-in-path pages for every search term.

## Canonical And Indexing

For service page query variants:

```text
Visitor URL:
/services/retractable-awning?ad_kw=retractable_awning&ad_audience=home&ad_area=bangkok

Canonical:
/services/retractable-awning
```

For local page query variants:

```text
Visitor URL:
/services/retractable-awning/bangkok?ad_audience=home

Canonical:
/services/retractable-awning/bangkok
```

Rules:

- Query variants are not included in sitemap.
- Query variants do not get distinct canonical URLs.
- Dynamic content must remain crawlable and useful if query parameters are absent.
- Do not block query variants in `robots.txt`; Google AdsBot may crawl them.

## Campaign URL Examples

Core service:

```text
https://www.siamrooftech.com/services/retractable-awning?ad_kw=retractable_awning&ad_intent=quote&utm_source=google_paid&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=TH_Search_NonBrand_Core&utm_term={keyword}&utm_content={creative}&srt_platform=google&srt_campaignid={campaignid}&srt_adgroupid={adgroupid}&srt_adid={creative}&srt_keyword={keyword}&srt_matchtype={matchtype}&srt_device={device}&srt_network={network}&srt_location={loc_physical_ms}
```

Bangkok home:

```text

```

Electric awning:

```text

```

## Measurement Rules

Every tracked lead event should include:

- `page_path`
- `page_location`
- `attribution_latest_utm_campaign`
- `attribution_latest_utm_term`
- `attribution_latest_srt_campaignid`
- `attribution_latest_srt_adgroupid`
- `attribution_latest_srt_keyword`
- `attribution_latest_srt_matchtype`
- `attribution_latest_srt_device`
- `attribution_latest_srt_location`
- `ad_kw`
- `ad_audience`
- `ad_area`
- `ad_intent`

Dynamic token reporting answers:

- Which approved service token converted?
- Which audience token converted?
- Which area token converted?
- Which keyword/ad group drove low-quality clicks?
- Which token combination deserves a dedicated `/lp/google-ads/...` page?

## QA Contract

Required checks before enabling Ads traffic:

- Valid token URL returns `200`.
- Invalid token URL still returns `200` and falls back safely.
- Canonical remains clean without query parameters.
- No query variant appears in sitemap.
- No raw `srt_keyword` or raw `{keyword}` value is rendered into the page.
- `localStorage.siamrooftech_attribution_v1` stores `ad_*`, `srt_*`, `utm_*`, `gclid`, `gbraid`, and `wbraid`.
- LINE click and phone click include attribution and dynamic token context.
- Mobile headline does not overflow when all valid token combinations are used.

Example invalid-token QA URL:

```text
http://localhost:3000/services/retractable-awning?ad_kw=cheap_unknown_keyword&srt_keyword=กันสาดพับเก็บได้ราคาถูกที่สุด
```

Expected:

- Page renders default service copy or approved fallback copy.
- Raw `cheap_unknown_keyword` is not visible.
- Raw `กันสาดพับเก็บได้ราคาถูกที่สุด` from `srt_keyword` is not visible.

## Implementation Change Requests

P0:

- Add an approved dynamic token map in `src/lib/google-ads-dynamic-content.ts`.
- Extend `src/lib/gtm.ts` to capture `ad_*`, `srt_*`, `gad_source`, and `gad_campaignid`.
- Add server/client helper that resolves dynamic copy from the current page path and approved tokens.
- Update service landing pages to accept safe dynamic copy overrides without changing canonical metadata.
- Add Ads QA checks for valid token, invalid token, canonical, and raw keyword non-rendering.

P1:

- Track `ad_*` values on `line_click` and `phone_click`.
- Add a small approved dynamic FAQ or CTA support line per audience token.
- Add reporting examples to the Google Ads launch plan.

P2:

- Build dedicated `/lp/google-ads/...` pages only when dynamic service pages show useful traffic but weak conversion.
- Add offline lead quality loop later, after CRM or lead review workflow exists.

## Final Position

Dynamic keyword insertion is allowed only as controlled dynamic copy insertion.

The system should personalize by approved intent tokens, not by arbitrary keyword text.
